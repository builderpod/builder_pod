Our attention to detail and customer satisfaction has made it possible for us to continue servicing the public. For almost 100 years our family name has been involved with the construction industry. In the 1920 desperate to give his family a good life in America my grandfather started his roofing business. His business was known as Leon Impo Roofing and was located in South Philadelphia. Later he branched out and started to install heating systems and dig out basements. When he started his business choices were limited but family ties were strong so my dad and his 4 brothers worked for their father, until they each branched off into different construction trades. My father, Leo took over my grandfathers business back in 1954 and changed the name to Leon Impo Jr. Roofing. Along with roofing and heating my father added on siding and would often boast of doing the first aluminum siding job in South Philadelphia. Around 1968 carpentry also became apart of the services he provided to may Philadelphia homeowners. As for his brothers, one became a masonry contractor and another who specialed in plumbing and electrical contracting. With the diversity in construction none of brothers competed for business instead they worked together on many group project. My brother John and I started working for my dad and learned not only my dad's crafts but learned Masonry from Uncle Mikie and Electrical and Plumbing from Uncle Jimmie. Then in 1978 we moved to Blackwood, New Jersey John and I partnered with my dad and changed the company name to Imp-Pro's. Since then we have become more of a design building contractors working on anything from minor repairs to major structural defect repairs, to additions and new home construction. Thanks to Dad our hands on knowledge helps us on every project. The pride in the family name and business has passed the test of time. As will any project we do for you with our personalized attention to detail, professional high quality services and hands on experience which always equal a successful project.
